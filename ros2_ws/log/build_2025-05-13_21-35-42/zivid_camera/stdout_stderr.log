[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:33 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindZivid.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Zivid", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Zivid" (requested
  version 2.15.0) with any of the following names:

    ZividConfig.cmake
    zivid-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Zivid" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "Zivid_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Zivid"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
