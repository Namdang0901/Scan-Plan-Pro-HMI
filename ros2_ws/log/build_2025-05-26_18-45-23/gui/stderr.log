[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:58 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindQwt.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "Qwt", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qwt" with any of
  the following names:

    QwtConfig.cmake
    qwt-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "Qwt" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "Qwt_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "Qwt" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
